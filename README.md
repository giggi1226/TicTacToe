# TicTacToe

• Implement	the	game	of	Tic-Tac-Toe.	
• Show	the	gameboard	as	a	background	image	using	an	Interface	
Builder	UIImageView
• Each	UIBuaon	on	the	gameboard	toggles	from:		
– “X”	then	“O”	then	“space”	then	repeat.	
• Add	a	reset	buaon	which	changes	all	the	buaons	to	“space”.	(You	
are	not	wri,ng	code	to	determine	if	there	is	a	winner).	Use	“Outlet	
Collec,ons”	to	simplify	addressing	the	buaons.		
• Create	a	Gameboard	Class	where	you	store	the	state	of	each	buaon	
in	an	NSMutableArray	and	send	messages	to	the	Gameboard	to	
modify	game	state.	This	will	be	your	Model	Class.		
• Program	is	due	Tues.	Sept.	22nd	at	11pm.	
• Extra	Credit:	Evalute	the	state	of	the	board	and	announce	a	winner	
like	“X	wins!”.
